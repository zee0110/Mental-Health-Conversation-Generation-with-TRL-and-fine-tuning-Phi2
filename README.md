#### Mental Health Conversation Generation with TRL and Phi2

This project focuses on generating mental health counseling conversations using the Transfer and Represent Learning (TRL) technique with the Phi2 model. It leverages PyTorch, Hugging Face's Transformers library, and other related libraries for model training and fine-tuning. The conversation dataset used for training is loaded from the Hugging Face Datasets repository, preprocessed, and formatted accordingly.

#### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system along with the necessary libraries:
- torch
- peft
- trl
- accelerate
- einops
- tqdm
- scipy
- datasets
- bitsandbytes==0.40.2
- transformers==4.31.0

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```
pip install torch peft trl accelerate einops tqdm scipy datasets bitsandbytes==0.40.2 transformers==4.31.0
```

#### Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the code files.
2. Run the code using a Python interpreter.
3. The code will load the conversation dataset, preprocess it, and format it into the required input format.
4. It then initializes the Phi2 model with the necessary configurations and prepares it for k-bit training.
5. Training arguments and configurations such as batch size, learning rate, evaluation strategy, etc., are specified.
6. The TRL Trainer is instantiated with the model, training dataset, configurations, tokenizer, and training arguments.
7. The Trainer trains the model on the conversation dataset, generating mental health counseling conversations.

#### Features

- Loads and preprocesses mental health conversation dataset.
- Initializes and prepares the Phi2 model for k-bit training.
- Utilizes Transfer and Represent Learning (TRL) technique for model fine-tuning.
- Trains the model to generate mental health counseling conversations.
- Implements logging, evaluation, and saving checkpoints during training.
